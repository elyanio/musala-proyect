* ## Once this repo is copied in the local PC, or cloned from GitHub 

### Available Scripts

`yarn`
##### Installs all dependencies of the package.json.
* To copy all packages in the Node Module File.

`yarn dev`
##### Runs the app in the development mode.
* Open to view it in the console.


### Create a local .env file
To run correctly this app, it's mandatory to create a .env file with local variables like

1- REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT = https://musala-proyect.herokuapp.com/

2- SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true

3- REACT_APP_CRYPTO_JS_SECRET='ijfw9-48etfw';

Once you create this file with these variable inside, you must restart the whole node app, to take effects over the code
